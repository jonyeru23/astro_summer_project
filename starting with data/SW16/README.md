#The first model - SW16

All the important code is in functions.py

important note - there are two options for n, so everything is double.


The data is in apparent magnitude. The theoretical models gives us 
luminosity (eq 6) and Temperature (eq 8) in Iair's paper.

But we need apparent magnitude, so we assume a blackbody raidation and acoording 
ti the luminosity and temperature we can get the apparent magnitude.

That is the main challenge.
